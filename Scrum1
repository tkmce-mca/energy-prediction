Current Status:
      Download and install Python,Anaconda,Spyder.
      Learn more about energy,weather,temperature.
      Creating Datasets of power consumption.
      Learning python.
Plans for the current week and comming week:
      Create the full datasets of power consumption.
      Create datasets of rainfall,temperature.
      Learn how to implement CNN-LSTM model in energy prediction.
Open issues:
      Now we don't have dataset, now we trying to create datasets of daily power consumption,rainfall,temperature data of about 5 years.
      So we need time.
