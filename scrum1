      creating data set of power consumption
      learing python
plans for the week:
      create the whole data set of power, rainfall,temperature
      learn how to implement tne cnn and lstn algorith in python.
Open issues
      we don't have a data set and we are now creating 3 types of data set and it is very time consuming and we are not getting enough time to learn how to code
      and it is a big issue. i think that by next week this problem will be solved and we will be able to code.
